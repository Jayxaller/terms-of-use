  <h1>Privacy Policy for ZENITH</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2024</p>
  
  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to ZENITH. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we use and how we use it. Our Application uses the TikTok API for authentication and video uploads, and we do not collect additional personal data.
  </p>
  
  <h2>2. Information We Use</h2>
  <p>
    The Application only handles data provided by TikTok during the OAuth flow and video upload process. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access Token, Refresh Token, and Open ID:</strong> Provided by TikTok to authenticate API calls.</li>
    <li><strong>Video Metadata:</strong> Any minimal information (e.g., title or description) that you optionally add for video uploads.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not actively collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.
  </p>
  
  <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use the data solely to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable secure authentication via the TikTok API.</li>
    <li>Facilitate video uploads on your TikTok account.</li>
    <li>Enhance and maintain the functionality of our Application.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Sensitive tokens are handled only in memory and are not stored in plaintext. Our Application is designed to use these tokens temporarily to make API calls, and they are not logged or permanently stored.
  </p>
  
  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You have the right to revoke the Application’s access at any time via TikTok’s account settings. For any concerns about your personal data, please review TikTok’s privacy policy.
  </p>
  
  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Your continued use of our Application constitutes acceptance of any updates.
  </p>
